[Verse 1]
Bm
It's so hard to let go
Bm
You can hear me but I'm invisible
G
But if you dig out your eyes, maybe pain will subside
                                                A
The worst that could happen is you never see me again
                        Em       Bm
But the worst is yet to come, my friend
 
 
[Chorus]
C   Bm
This path I walk is comforting
                                    G
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
    Em      A
I'm fading faster now
 
 
[Verse 2]
Bm
I left so long ago
Bm
You never noticed I was gone
         G
Now that you don't have eyes, maybe now you'll realize
 
Within your own head, you're creating these lies
A
For what it's worth, you're still beautiful
       Em                  A (Let ring)
But beauty lies within the eyes
 
 
[Chorus]
     Bm
This path I walk is comforting
    Bm                              G
But now I'm left to sing this song alone
    Em
I'm fading faster now
Bm
It's time to walk away with nothing left
                    G
Nothing left in my soul
     Em      A
I've faded into myself

This path I walk is comforting
    Bm (Light strum)                G

I'm fading faster now
Bm
It's time to walk away with nothing left
                   G
Nothing left in my soul
    Em         A        G
I'm fading faster now
     Em      A    Bm
I've faded into myself
