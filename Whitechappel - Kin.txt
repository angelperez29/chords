[Intro]
Em G C x2
 
[Verse 1]
Em       G               C
Remember when we used to be inseparable
Em                 G                  C
And the late nights sitting by the fire
Em                      G                   C
We'd fall asleep knowing we would wake up by each other's side
C                                 D      Em
We never had the fear that we were losing time
Em       G               C
Remember the sound of the voice that would call our name
Em                 G                  C
A sense of comfort fell upon our heart
Em                      G                   C
Now the voice fades in thе distance, a life changed in an instant
C                                 D      Em
I can't look at you bеcause it's tearing me apart
 
[Chorus]
C      D   Asus2
And I know you want us to be together
G      G/F# Em
And I know it's hard to accept forever
C                  D           Asus2
Our delusion is the easy way out
G                 G/F#          Em
But it's time for both of us to let this go
 
[Verse 2]
Em               G              C
I didn't mean to hold you back from moving on
Em                  G                  C
I understand that we can't keep going on like this
Em                      G              C
Can I just have one last moment to say goodbye?
C                              D        Em
I need to feel them against me one last time
 
[Chorus]
C      D   Asus2
And I know you want us to be together
G      G/F# Em
And I know it's hard to accept forever
C                  D           Asus2
Our delusion is the easy way out
                  G             G/F#     Em
But it's time for both of us to let this go
